# How the game works and steps to follow:

```
The game starts when the start button is clicked

When the game starts, the index is increased to 1, and then the computer array is added one variable from the randomly generated color with the math functions.

When the game starts, the title element is updated to the current level/index of the game

Then, the user clicks on the pattern which they believe is correct. 
When a button is clicked, then a sound is played for the corresponding value and the button is flashed

The user input is compared against the computer array to see if it is correct
