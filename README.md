  ### Description:

  - This is a recreation of the classic Simon game where the player tests their memory by repeating a computer generated pattern. The game starts at level 1 where only 1 color/tone is displayed, and the user has to click on the same color/tile/button correctly in order to proceed to the next level. As the game progresses, the difficulty increases by the pattern displaying quicker. There is no time limit, but time will be tracked to differentiate high scores by the user.
